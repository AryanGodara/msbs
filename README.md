# Slot Booking System
The base repository to store the main branch and the slot booking system.

## Create your own python3 virtual environment (use python >= 3.8) (preferred is 3.11)
## Django version used for this project is 4.0 (new enough, and behind 4.2 to avoid recent bugs and get mature documentation)
## In this directory, run :-
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prerequisites -> Install python3, pip, virtualenv, and other basic tools needed to setup a python virtual environment.
